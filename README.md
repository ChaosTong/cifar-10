# PyTorch Project

This project is designed to implement a machine learning model using PyTorch. It includes various components such as data handling, model definition, training logic, and testing.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains datasets and related documentation.
- **models/**: Contains model architectures and their documentation.
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.
- **src/**: Contains the source code for the project.
  - **dataset.py**: Defines the dataset class for loading and preprocessing data.
  - **model.py**: Defines the model class for building and training the model.
  - **train.py**: Contains the training logic and model evaluation.
  - **utils.py**: Contains utility functions for visualization, model saving, and loading.
- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for the model to ensure functionality.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the required Python packages and their versions.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Installation

To install the required packages, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Modify the `src/model.py` to define your model architecture.
3. Use `src/train.py` to set up the training loop and start training your model.
4. Run tests in the `tests/` directory to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
